### Framework 

We wanted to make an entertainment aggregator to keep users updated on what is trending. Using third party API'S such as the Movie DB, You Tube
and Entertainment Weekly we want each user to be able to share their favorites. I was in charge of the front end making sure the design was 
user friendly as well as modern and sleek. Chance and Shaneal was in charge of the back-end to make sure all of the user functions are stored
in our database.

### Challenges
- Ensuring each user was able to communicate to another user (adding friends, sending messages, sharing videos)
- Making sure each others code does not break when pushing and pulling to the origin master.
